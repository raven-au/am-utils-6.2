- update vers.m4 to the new version you want to release: then rerun ./bootstrap
- update NEWS w/ appropriate items
- might have to commit/push at this point, not sure
- ./configure <args>; make ; make check
- make distcheck: that should generate a tar.gz w/ version number to drop into
  the ftp/http server
- if you haven't committed your files and pushed them yet, now's the time
- I also like to tag the current trunk:
	git tag -a am-utils-X_Y[abc]Z
  or
	git tag -a am-utils-X_Y_rcZ
- email announcement to am-utils-announce@am-utils.org (look for "standard"
  announcements I made in the past)
